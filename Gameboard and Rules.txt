RULES: 
1. Each turn starts off with the player rolling 2 die
2. Each time a player lands on or passes over “GO”, they will be paid a $200 salary :D
3. Jail: 
	• If a player lands on “GO TO JAIL”, they will go directly to jail without getting any sort of 'passing go' payment 
	• Houses and rent can still be bought and collected when the player in is jail
	• To get out of jail, the criminal can choose between paying a fine of $100 and going the next round, or waiting 4 rounds
4. Buying Properties: 
	• A player can only buy a property if it's unowned and they land on it
	• The price of the property is written in the file and will also be printed out when a player land on that property
5. Buying Houses:
	• A player can only buy houses for properties in a full colour set owned by them 
		• ex: Jane can only buy a house for Ottawa if she also has Seoul and Rome (green set)
	• The prices of houses for each propery is in the file and will also be printed when the player is ready to buy a house
6. Rent (PAY ATTENTION TO THIS):
	• When a player lands on a property owned by another player, the owner collects rent
	• Rent Price:
		• Rent for railroads, the electric company, and waterworks is 20% of the original property price
		• Rent for the rest of the properties is 10% of the original property price
		• Rent price doubles once a player obtain all the properties in a colour set
		• Rent increases by 5% of the original property price (rounded) for each house on the square
			• ex:  Delhi ($60) with 3 houses --> rent: $6(2) + $3 + $3 + $3 = $21
7. If a player owes more money than they can pay, they must give everything they have to the person they owe the money to (bank/player) 
   and retire from the game :(
